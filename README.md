# README

## To use Client Keeper:

* Clone or download the repository

* Run `bundle install`

* Run some migrations to seed some minimal data (`rails db:migrate`)

* Finally to start up the app run `rails server`


## A couple notes
This is still a work in progress so...

* Please note that there are some areas that would create serious security risks in a real life scenario.

* Tests are primarily not yet set up

* There is a lot of excess in the schema/db (and the app in general)

* And most of all, please feel free to offer any suggestions or point out any issues!
